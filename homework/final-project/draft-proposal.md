Investigating Personal Belief Exemptions in Bay Area Schools

As I work toward my final masters’ thesis project, I’m looking at examining cracks in vaccine regulations for our state’s schools. There are several ways to avoid vaccinations that I know of based on preliminary research (formal exemptions, being a teacher – many schools don’t require teachers’ records, or getting some vaccines and promising to get the remainder at some point throughout the school year. Formal exemptions include medical reasons (kids with compromised immune systems), religious exemptions, and personal belief exemptions. The latter, “PBE,” are by far the most nebulous and allow parents to basically come up with any reason they can think of for not vaccinating their kids. 

Mercury News published a piece on PBEs last week, citing that the rate of this type of exemption has tripled since 2000 in California. That means nearly one kid in every class carries one of these exemptions for no medical or religious reason, presenting a potential risk to his peers. 

Also last week, two California Democratic Senators proposed a bill to end all PBEs, leaving only religion and medical reasons as legit causes for vaccine exemptions. If approved, there is speculation that banning religious exemptions could be next on the docket.  

California Department of Public Health keeps up to date annual records of vaccinations across schools in California, sorted by county. The data include total exemptions, as well as PBE, religious exemptions and medical exemptions. Data go back to 2001. 

For this project, I’d like to go back through the data for each year from 2001-2015 and analyze potential trends in PBEs within Bay Area schools. I intend to build a script that can download relevant data from CDPH here: http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/immunize/pages/immunizationlevels.aspx , sort by school, and then graph PBE trends by school. 

This data will help inform my analysis as to what material impact, if any, a ban on PBEs would have within Bay Area Schools and where that impact might be greatest. Once I build a body of scripts to manipulate this data, I’m hoping I can make small tweaks to it in order to also analyze religious exemptions, medical exemptions, and other line items toward my eventual thesis analysis.
