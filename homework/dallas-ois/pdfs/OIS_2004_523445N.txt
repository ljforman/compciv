On Saturday, July 10, 2004, at 6:30 A.M, a uniformed patrol officer in a marked vehicle was traveling
westbound on Knight Street when he noticed a suspicious vehicle. As the officer turned around to
investigate, the vehicle occupied by a W/M/26 suspect sped off. The suspect was located walking on
Lemmon Avenue. The suspect then failed to comply with verbal commands by the officer and a struggle
between the officer and suspect ensued. The suspect then fled on foot while holding a handgun in his
hand. The suspect ran to the porch of 4122 Rawlings Street, began pacing back and forth holding the
weapon to his head. The officer gave verbal commands to the suspect to put the gun down, but the
suspect raised the gun and pointed it at the officer. The officer fired his weapon striking him. The
suspect bent forward then stood up again and raised his gun at the officer. The officer fired his weapon
at the suspect striking him again. The officer then heard two shots come from where the suspect had
fallen to the ground. It was determined by the Dallas Medical Examiner that suspect’s fatal wound was
a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
