On Wednesday, August 20, 2014, at approximately 11:44 P.M., uniformed patrol officers driving a
marked vehicle were assigned in a high crime area at 7921 LBJ Freeway. Officers were driving through
the rear parking lot when they observed a vehicle that they believed could be stolen. As the officers
were positioning their vehicle, the brake and reverse lights of the suspect vehicle illuminated briefly. As

cover position behind their vehicle waiting for other officers to arrive. A single gunshot from inside the
suspect’s vehicle was then heard.
The suspect committed suicide and was pronounced deceased at the scene.
