On Wednesday, June 26, 2013, at approximately 9:00 P.M., uniformed officers in a marked vehicle
responded to a theft in progress call at 1921 Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard where a security guard
was holding a possibly armed suspect at gunpoint. Officers gave verbal commands to the B/M/47
suspect to place his hands on their vehicle, but the suspect refused and began reaching into his pockets.
One officer then deployed a Taser on the suspect. The suspect removed the prongs and began running
down the street. The officers pursued him and the suspect ran into a business at 2310 Martin Luther
King Jr. Boulevard. The suspect, who now had a knife in his hand, was attempting to hold the door shut
to prevent the officers from entering. The suspect opened the door and lunged at one officer. Both
officers fired their weapons at the suspect striking him two times.
The suspect was injured and transported to Baylor Hospital.
Suspect was armed with a knife.
The suspect was charged with Aggravated Assault Public Servant.
