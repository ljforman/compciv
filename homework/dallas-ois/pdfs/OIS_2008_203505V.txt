On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximately 9:15 P.M., a uniformed off-duty officer was working in an off
duty capacity for a business at 2900 Wheatland Road. The officer reported an armed B/M suspect
entered the business and forced him to the cash room. There he demanded employees open the cash
room door. An employee disrupted the robbery by initiating the fire alarm. The suspect then directed
the officer to a field adjacent to the business. The officer reported hearing the hammer click back and
believing he was about to be shot by the suspect, pushed the suspect aside who fled on foot. The
suspect stopped after a few feet and looked back at the officer, at which time the officer fired 3 times at
the suspect missing him.
The offense was later unfounded.
The officer was terminated for a violation of departmental policy and charged with Aggravated Robbery.
Involved Officer: B/M/ 3 years, 10 months service.
