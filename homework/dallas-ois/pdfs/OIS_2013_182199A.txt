On Wednesday, July 17, 2013, at approximately 10:00 P.M., uniformed patrol officers in a marked
vehicle responded to a burglary in progress call at 1639 Conner Drive. A neighbor met the officers and
stated that there were noises coming from the house next door and he believed it was being
burglarized. One officer walked to the rear of the residence and utilizing his flashlight, observed the
L/M/19 suspect standing inside the residence. The suspect came outside and curled into a semi-ball
position on the ground. Another officer climbed over the fence into the backyard to cover the original
officer who holstered his weapon and drew his Taser. The suspect turned and threw an object at the
original officer striking him in the head. The suspect jumped up, charged the cover officer while
extending his arm toward him. The cover officer fired his weapon striking the suspect one time.
The suspect was pronounced deceased at Baylor Hospital.
The suspect was unarmed.
No officer was injured.
One officer fired 1 round. Involved Officer: B/M 10 months service.
