On Monday, August 6, 2007, at approximately 5:15 A.M., uniformed patrol officers in a marked vehicle
responded to a robbery in progress call at 9100 Stone Creek Place. The individual that was being robbed
stated the W/M/37 suspect was armed because he kept one hand behind his back, hidden from view.

commit “suicide” by cop. The suspect taunted officers and kept one hand behind his back leading the
officers to believe he was holding a weapon. The suspect quickly and aggressively moved both hands
forward and one officer fired his weapon striking the suspect one time.
Suspect was pronounced deceased at Presbyterian Hospital.
Suspect was not armed.
No officer was injured.
One officer fired 1 round. Involved Officer: 1 year, 8 months service.
